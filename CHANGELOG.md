## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 15: 6 pos errors + 27 def normalizations

### POS errors fixed (6)
Words TSL labels as verb but the def + Chinese describe the noun:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| pants | pos:verb (def correctly noun-form already) | pos:noun |
| toll | pos:verb, def: "a small cost or fee you pay to use a service" (noun-form) | pos:noun |
| institute | pos:verb, def: "like a school or college" | pos:noun, def: "an organisation set up for educational or research purposes" |
| grill | pos:verb, def: "like a barbeque, something you cook on" | pos:noun, def: "a metal frame used for cooking food over heat" |
| rumor | pos:verb, def: "something said by people but not necessarily true" | pos:noun, def: "a story passed between people that may or may not be true" |
| attire | pos:verb, def: "clothing, especially for a special occasion" | pos:noun |

### Def normalizations (27)

Three classes:
1. **Capital-T inconsistency** (lowercase rest of corpus, but a few had `"To make..."`): automate, vend, sue.
2. **Verb defs missing leading `to`** (most defs start with "to ..." for consistency): notify, renovate, inspect, verify, equip, remodel, fasten, rehearse, tow, browse, downsize, personalize, steer.
3. **Wrong-subject / awkward defs**:
   - puzzle (verb): "something you do not understand" → "to confuse someone or cause them to think hard"
   - clap (verb): "hitting your hands together..." → "to hit your hands together to make a noise, often in praise"
   - signify (verb): "shows a sign that..." → "to indicate or be a sign of something"
   - dive (verb): "jump in or swim under water" → "to jump head-first into water, or to descend sharply"
   - renovation (noun): "the process of being restored..." (passive voice) → "the act of restoring something to a better condition"

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 14: distractor semantic check + 50-question deep audit

### 1. Synonym distractor semantic-overlap check — clean

Built a transitive synonym/antonym graph and verified that for every syn/ant question, none of the 3 distractors are also valid syn/ant of the target (1-hop transitive). Generated 500 questions and checked. **0 issues found.** The existing exclusion logic in `generateSynonymQuestions` correctly filters all valid alternatives.

### 2. Cloze with diacritics / hyphens — clean

Verified `résumé`, `café`, `e-book`, `cellphone` all generate cloze prompts without leaking the answer or breaking the regex. **All 4 work correctly.**

### 3. Visual 50-question audit — 6 more fixes

Generated and inspected 50 random questions (30 cloze + 20 fillblank). Found:

#### `headquarter` still misaligned (slipped past round 12)
- Chinese: 總部 (noun)
- TSL pos was: verb (after my round-12 def rewrite)
- Mismatch: player picks 總部 (noun) but reveal shows verb-form def

Fixed:
- pos: verb → **noun**
- def: "to base the main office..." → "the main office where an organisation is based"
- example: "The company is headquartered in Singapore." → "Our headquarters is located in downtown Singapore."

#### Three more def errors

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **accurately** | "when something is done correctly" *(awkward "when X" form for an adverb)* | "in a way that is correct and precise" |
| **weekday** | "All the working days in a week, usually Monday to Friday" *(plural-sense def for singular noun)* | "any day of the week from Monday to Friday" |
| **tablet** | "a small flat solid cake of some substance" *(only pill sense)* | "a flat handheld electronic device, or a small solid pill" |

#### Two awkward example sentences

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| franchise | "McDonalds has exported its franchise." *(missing apostrophe + unusual collocation)* | "The restaurant franchise has over 200 locations worldwide." |
| pad | "Take notes on the meeting pad before the discussion ends." *(meeting pad is unusual)* | "She wrote her notes on a yellow legal pad during the interview." |

- 500-question smoke distribution healthy
- 0 syn/ant transitive distractor overlaps
- Cloze regex robust to diacritics and hyphens

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 13: programmatic POS-in-example detection + visual sample audit

User directive (continuing): **「不會有懷疑」**.

### 1. Programmatic POS-in-example check — 20 fixes

Built a heuristic that infers the POS of how the target word is **actually used** in its example sentence (look at preceding article / "to" / inflection / surrounding context). Compared to TSL's `pos` field. Found 20 examples where the example uses the word as a different POS than TSL says — same trap class as `intern` from round 12.

| Word | TSL pos | Example used as | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| clerk | noun | verb past ("clerked for the supreme court judge") | "The clerk at the front desk helped me fill out the form." |
| courier | noun | verb past ("had the contract couriered") | "The courier delivered the package this morning." |
| ladder | noun | verb past ("I've laddered my tights") *British slang* | "He climbed the ladder to reach the top shelf." |
| towel | noun | verb past ("toweled himself dry") | "Please bring a clean towel from the cupboard." |
| scarf | noun | informal verb ("you sure scarfed that pizza") | "She wore a warm wool scarf around her neck." |
| petition | noun | verb past ("villagers petitioned the council") | "The petition gathered over a thousand signatures last week." |
| skateboard | noun | gerund ("Skateboarding is not allowed") | "He bought a new skateboard for his birthday." |
| fountain | noun | rare verb ("Lava fountained from the volcano") | "A beautiful fountain stands in the middle of the plaza." |
| apprentice | noun | verb past ("was apprenticed to a local employer") | "She started as an apprentice in the bakery five years ago." |
| vendor | noun | software jargon ("vendored copies of CPAN modules") | "Each vendor must register before the trade fair begins." |
| fixture | noun | adj participle ("fixtured models") | "Each bathroom fixture in the hotel is energy efficient." |
| graphic | adj | "the graphics are amazing" (used as plural noun) | "The poster has a bold graphic design." |
| residential | adj | "annual residentials" (used as plural noun) | "The new residential complex includes a swimming pool." |
| prospective | adj | "meeting the prospectives" (plural noun) | "Several prospective clients visited our showroom this week." |
| desirable | adj | "plenty of desirables" (plural noun) | "A spacious office in the city centre is highly desirable." |
| exotic | adj | physics jargon ("Glueballs are exotics") | "The restaurant serves exotic dishes from across Asia." |
| incomplete | adj | academic plural noun ("got four incompletes") | "The form was returned because it was incomplete." |
| casual | adj | gaming slang ("the casuals could enjoy it") | "The office dress code is casual every Friday." |
| absent | adj | rare verb ("temporarily absented themselves") | "The manager was absent from the morning meeting." |
| dull | adj | verb ("Years of misuse have dulled the tools") | "The lecture was dull and uninspiring." |

After-fix scan: **0 remaining POS-in-example mismatches**.

### 2. Visual sample of 50 questions — 4 hidden defects caught

Generated 50 random questions and visually inspected each. Found 4 problems my programmatic checks missed:

| Word | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **frustrate** | Def: "to become upset because of not being able to do something" — describes the **wrong subject**! `frustrate` is transitive ("to frustrate someone"), not intransitive ("to feel frustrated"). | "to prevent someone from achieving a goal, causing them to feel upset" |
| **nominate** | Def has grammar error: "to suggest someone **for to do** or be something" | "to formally suggest someone for a position or award" |
| **administer** | Def: "to manage an office" — too narrow. Example used the medicine sense. | "to manage operations, or to give medicine or treatment" |
| **mileage** | Example used figurative sense ("a lot of mileage in language… in research") but def was literal "distance in miles". | New example: "Our delivery van has high mileage after years of service." |

`frustrate` was particularly bad — for years learners would have answered "我感到沮喪" but the def teaches the wrong subject relationship.

### Verification
- TS clean
- 500-question smoke: distribution healthy across 7 types
- POS-in-example scan: 0 remaining mismatches

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 12: POS-coherence pass — every word's pos / def / Chinese / example are now mutually consistent

User directive this round: **「內容為最高準則，不會有懷疑」** — every piece of content shown to the player must be self-consistent so they never doubt the question. Round 12 is a coherence audit across the four data fields per word: TSL pos, English definition, Chinese gloss (`lookupChinese`), and example sentence.

### 1. POS / def-leader mismatch — 47 fixes

Detected programmatically: scan every TSL entry for noun-pos with `to ...` def, adj-pos with `a/an/the ...` def (noun-shaped), or vice versa. 86 candidates flagged, 47 needed real fixes.

Highlights of clear errors:

| Word | TSL pos | Before (mismatched) | After |
|---|---|---|---|
| reservation | noun | "to put something on hold for use later" | "the act of putting something on hold for later use" |
| audit | noun | "to check something is correct" | "an official examination of business accounts and finances" |
| delegate | noun | "to give others tasks to do" | "a representative chosen to act on behalf of others" |
| revision | noun | "to change or rewrite something" | "a change or improvement made to a piece of work" |
| brake | noun | "to stop a vehicle by pressing a pedal" | "a device for slowing or stopping a vehicle" |
| calculation | noun | "to add, subtract, multiply, divide etc." | "a mathematical computation or careful estimate" |
| manual | adj | "a book that explains how to do something" | "done or operated by hand, not by machine" *(then re-aligned to noun, see #2)* |
| oval | adj | "A shape that looks like an egg" | "having a shape like an elongated circle, like an egg" |
| explanatory | adj | "to explain or make clear" | "intended to make something clearer" |

…plus 38 others including sunny, innovative, thorough, optional, protective, knowledgeable, generous, realistic, loyal, mechanical, promotional, residential, graphic, costly, managerial, enthusiastic, superior, overhead, administrative, headquarter, malfunction.

### 2. Cross-field sense alignment — 7 deeper realignments

Fixing the def alone wasn't enough when the four fields disagreed about WHICH SENSE of a polysemous word the question is testing. Re-aligned 7 to fully match:

| Word | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **intern** | TSL def "to work as a trainee" but example was "The US government interned thousands of Japanese-Americans during WW2" — that's the **imprison** sense, totally different word. | New example: "The summer intern joined our marketing team last week." Pos→noun. Def→noun-form. |
| **cruise** | Chinese 遊輪 (cruise ship, noun) but TSL pos verb and example "Germany cruised to a World Cup victory" (verb). | All four fields aligned to noun: "a sea voyage on a large ship for pleasure"; example "They booked a one-week cruise to the Caribbean." |
| **lounge** | Chinese 休息室 (noun) but TSL pos verb. | Pos→noun. Def→noun-form. Example uses noun. |
| **eager** | TSL pos was **noun** (clearly wrong — eager is adj). | Pos→adj. |
| **manual** | Chinese 手冊 (noun: a manual book) but TSL pos adj. | Pos→noun. Def→noun-form. Example "user manual" already noun. |
| **alternate** | Chinese 替代的 (adj) but TSL pos verb. | Pos→adj. Def→adj-form. |
| **asleep** | TSL pos was **adv** (asleep is predicative adj). | Pos→adj. |
| **editorial** | Chinese 編輯的 (adj) but the natural example uses noun ("an editorial on the new tax policy"). | Reframed def to adj sense + new example: "The editorial team meets every Monday morning." |

### 3. Self-audit of my own rewrites in rounds 6/9/11

Sample-checked 30 of the ~300 examples I had hand-rewritten in earlier rounds. Found **3** that drifted from the correct sense:

| Word | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **assembly** | My example used "factory assembly line" (production sense), but Chinese 集會 = gathering of people. | "The school held a special assembly to honor the graduating students." |
| **documentary** | TSL pos was adj but Chinese 紀錄片 is noun. | Pos→noun. (Existing def "a film about a real life or event" already matches noun.) |
| **fleet** | Def restricted to ships, but Chinese 車隊 = vehicle fleet, and my example used trucks. | Broadened def to "a group of ships, planes, or vehicles operated by one organisation". |

### Why this matters
Before round 12, a player answering vocab question for `intern` would see:
- Word: intern
- Correct Chinese: 實習生 (trainee)
- Reveal sentence: "The US government interned thousands of Japanese-Americans during WW2"

That's two **different words** sharing one spelling. The reveal would actively confuse a learner who answered correctly. Same kind of trap was lurking in 50+ other words. All caught and fixed.

### Verification
- TS clean (backend + frontend)
- 300-question smoke test: all 7 types fire in healthy proportions
- POS-vs-def-leader scan now baseline (remaining mismatches are dual-POS words like `manual` or `audit` where Chinese settles which sense)

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 11: silent give-away bug + 33 weak defs + NON_TOEIC prune + accessory wrong-sense

### 1. Silent cloze give-away bug — 14 examples mentioned the target word twice

The cloze generator's `replace(re, '___')` only replaces the **first** occurrence of the target word. So when an example has 2+ mentions, the answer remains visible in the displayed prompt.

Found and rewrote 14 affected examples:

| Word | Before (gives answer away) | After |
|---|---|---|
| subscribe | "Would you like to **subscribe** or **subscribe** a friend to our new magazine?" | "Would you like to subscribe to our weekly newsletter?" |
| renew | "I'd like to **renew** these three books. Did you know you can **renew** online?" | "I'd like to renew my library card before it expires." |
| internet | "Do you have **internet** at your place? My **internet** is down…" | "The internet connection in the office is very fast." |
| convey | "Air **conveys** sound. Water is **conveyed** through the pipe." | "The pipeline conveys oil across three states." |
| elephant | "One **elephant**, two **elephant**, three **elephant**…" | "An elephant uses its trunk to drink water." |
| pastry | "That **pastry** shop sells not just **pastries**…" | "The bakery sells fresh pastry every morning." |
| cheer | "I'm going to wear my new **cheer** shoes at **cheer** today." | "Loud cheers filled the stadium after the winning goal." |

…plus calendar, authority, nap, hourly, pie, faculty, fork (8 more). All now show only `___` in the cloze prompt with no answer leakage.

### 2. accessory had a WRONG-SENSE definition

Round 11 audit caught a real pedagogical error:

```
accessory → "partner in crime"
```

That's the **legal sense** ("an accessory to murder"). For TOEIC, accessory means a fashion/equipment add-on. The wrong def would teach learners a totally inappropriate sense for business contexts.

Fixed → `"an additional item, especially clothing, that goes with the main outfit"`

### 3. Sharpened 33 more weak defs in rank 200-1000

The fillblank def-rewrite work continues. Highlights:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| consumption | "the act of eating" (too narrow!) | "the using or eating of something, especially resources or food" |
| plug | "to fill in a hole" | "to block or fill an opening with a stopper" |
| unexpected | "to be a surprise" (clunky) | "happening without being predicted or anticipated" |
| headache | "pain in the head" | "a continuous pain in the head, or a difficult problem" |
| opt | "to make a choice" | "to formally choose one of several options" |
| dislike | "to not like, hate" | "to find something unpleasant or disagreeable" |
| reinforce | "to make stronger" (= 'stronger' itself!) | "to make something stronger or more secure" |
| adjacent | "next to, beside" | "lying next to or directly beside something" |
| terminate | "bring to an end" | "to bring an agreement or activity to an end" |
| attain | "to get or achieve" | "to succeed in achieving something through effort" |
| fiscal | "to do with money" | "relating to government or business finances" |

…plus 22 others (proofread, alert, remainder, harmful, beforehand, elegant, ongoing, enjoyable, hazardous, conform, individually, likewise, disconnect, fortunately, additionally, hike, incomplete, lounge, flyer, durable, resignation, considerably).

### 4. NON_TOEIC filter pruned

The auto-generated NON_TOEIC list over-filtered words that DO appear in TOEIC contexts. Removed:

- **Hotel/event amenities**: pillow, towel, curtain, candle, mirror, vase, blanket, carpet, broom, bucket
- **Workplace clothing**: jacket, sweater, scarf, sock
- **Purchase items**: cookie, chocolate, sandwich
- **Team-building**: basketball, baseball, volleyball, tennis, soccer, swimming
- **Industry topics**: chemistry, physics
- **Event types**: birthday, wedding, firework
- **Crime (business security)**: theft

Kept blocked: wild animals, body parts, religious terms, fantasy, weather wonders, niche school subjects (calculus, algebra, geometry, geography), niche sports (skiing, badminton, chess), medical conditions, etc.

Added inline comment documenting the rationale.

### 5. Confusable Chinese gloss audit — 91 pairs verified

All 91 zh1/zh2 fields in `learningExtras.json` confusables hand-verified for accuracy. **No fixes needed.** A few notes I made during audit:
- `valuable / invaluable: 有價值的 / 無價的` — kept the (somewhat ambiguous) 無價的 since the explanation field clarifies "珍貴到無法估價"
- `compose / comprise: 組成 / 包含` — comprise's gloss could be sharper (由…組成) but 包含 is acceptable

### Verification
- TS clean (backend + frontend)
- 30-batch (300 questions) smoke: every type fires, distribution healthy
- Cloze double-mention check: **0 give-aways** in 8-sample post-fix test

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 10: cloze coverage gap closed (1094 → 1250) + 14 example rewrites

### Discovery
After 50-sample cloze testing in round 9, I measured the actual cloze pool size and found a major coverage gap:

```
TSL words with examples:                    1250
  cloze-eligible (lemma exact match):       1094  ← only 87.5% reachable
  inflected-only match (skipped):            130
  no match at all (skipped):                  26
```

The cloze generator's regex was `\b{lemma}\b` — exact lemma form only. So an example like _"No newspaper published the victim's name."_ (target: `publish`) **was completely skipped** because the example uses `published`, not `publish`.

156 of 1250 TSL words (12.5%) were unreachable as cloze targets. The deeper-rank words (less common in lemma form in real sentences) were disproportionately affected.

### Fix 1: expanded cloze matcher with 13 inflection patterns

`buildClozeMatcher` now generates a regex that also matches:
- plural `-s` / `-es` and possessive `'s`
- past `-ed` / `-d`
- gerund `-ing`
- comparatives `-er` / `-est`
- adverb `-ly`
- y→ies / y→ied (try → tries / tried; certify → certified)
- doubled consonant for short CVC verbs (jam → jamming; slip → slipped)
- silent-e drop for `-ing` / `-ed` (dine → dining / dined)
- diacritic-stripped variant (résumé → resume) — for cases where the example uses an unaccented form

After fix: **1248 / 1250 cloze-eligible** (the remaining 2 are résumé and café where the diacritics break Node's `\b` boundary on accented characters — both got their examples rewritten in the unaccented spelling instead).

### Fix 2: rewrote 14 examples that didn't include the lemma at all

These 14 had examples that mentioned a related but distinct word (e.g., target `revision` but example uses verb `revised`). Rewrote each so the example actually uses the target word:

| Word | Before (didn't contain lemma) | After |
|---|---|---|
| revision | "What philosophy needs is to be **revised**…" | "Significant **revisions** were made to the report before final publication." |
| equip | "Each meeting room is **equipped** with…" | "We need to **equip** every new hire with the right training and tools." |
| statistics | "…he became just another **statistic**." (singular!) | "**Statistics** show a sharp rise in online shopping." |
| healthcare | "I think free **health care** should also cover…" (with space!) | "The new **healthcare** plan covers every full-time employee." |
| cooler | "Linen has made **cool** and breathable…" (just "cool"!) | "A portable **cooler** keeps drinks cold during summer picnics." |
| forbid | "Smoking in the restaurant is **forbidden**." | "Hospital rules **forbid** food and drink inside the operating room." |
| jeans | "She wore a tattered **jean** jacket." (singular adj!) | "These **jeans** fit perfectly and look great with a casual blazer." |
| considerate | "**Consider** that we've had three major events…" (verb!) | "She is always **considerate** of her colleagues' tight schedules." |
| timeline | "…disrupted the **timestream**." (different word!) | "Please review the project **timeline** before our next meeting." |
| videoconference | "…hold a **video conference** next week." (with space!) | "We will hold a **videoconference** with the Tokyo team tomorrow." |
| centimeter | "twenty **centimetres** deep" (UK spelling) | "twenty **centimeters** deep" |
| favorable | "made a **favourable** impression" (UK spelling) | "left a **favorable** review of our delivery service" |
| publicize | "scandal was **publicised**" (UK spelling) | "campaign aims to **publicize** the new product" |
| transmit | "The contract was **transmitted**…" (CVCC double-t) | "This satellite can **transmit** signals across the entire continent." |
| résumé | (used accented spelling, regex couldn't match) | "Please attach your **resume** to the online application." |
| café | (used accented spelling) | "Let's grab a coffee at the **cafe** across the street." |

### 100-sample cloze quality verification

Ran 100 unique-word cloze samples after the fix. **0 structural issues** (no missing blanks, no duplicate options).

Sample of inflected matches now firing as expected:

```
[publish] "No newspaper ___ the victim's name."          → publish
[cruise]  "Germany ___ to a World Cup victory…"          → cruise
[contradict] "His testimony ___ hers."                     → contradict
```

Player sees lemma form in options; the slot reads the inflected form when revealed (works because the underline rendering is the only visible change).

### Distribution after round 10 (200 curve questions)
```
vocab: 42   audio: 34   fillblank: 33   cloze: 31
confusable: 20   collocation: 20   synonym: 20
```

All 7 types continue to fire in the expected ratios.

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 9: deep stress-test of cloze + syn/ant content; another 115 template fragments swept

After shipping the cloze and synonym types in rounds 7-8, I 50-sample stress-tested cloze output and discovered MORE auto-generated template fragments survived. These weren't caught in round 6 because my regex was too narrow. This round I built a sentence-shape clustering tool that found them programmatically.

### 1. Found and fixed 3 more template patterns (115 examples total)

Round 6 caught 4 templates × 189 examples. Round 9 catches 3 more × 115:

| Template | Hits | Why broken |
|---|---|---|
| "We received the X from the vendor yesterday." | 60 | Vendors don't deliver people, drought, journalism, etc. |
| "The changes were X implemented last month." | 24 | Adverbs like "afterward, anytime, downstairs" don't fit |
| "The new X is Y for all departments." | 24 | Adjectives like "documentary, pharmaceutical" don't describe policies |
| "The X was Y finished ahead of schedule." | 8 | "lately/downstairs/periodically finished" is wrong sense |
| "He X agreed to the new terms." | 6 | "someday/traditionally agreed" is awkward |

(Some words appeared in multiple regex matches → 115 distinct.)

Hand-rewrote all 115 with natural sentences using each word's real meaning. Highlights:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| drought | "We received the drought from the vendor yesterday." | "The long drought reduced the region's wheat harvest by half." |
| internship | (same template) | "Her summer internship led to a full-time job offer." |
| journalism | (same template) | "He has worked in financial journalism for over a decade." |
| afterward | "The changes were afterward implemented last month." | "We had a meeting and went to dinner afterward." |
| pharmaceutical | "The new pharmaceutical is for all departments." | "The pharmaceutical industry invests heavily in cancer research." |
| documentary | "The new documentary is for all departments." | "The documentary about climate change won several awards." |
| sharply | "The project was sharply finished ahead of schedule." | "Stock prices fell sharply after the earnings report." |

After-fix scan: **0 remaining template patterns**. Programmatic shape-cluster tool now baseline at ≤4 per shape (no fake patterns).

### 2. Sharpened 13 weak fillblank defs in rank 1000-1250

Earlier rounds covered rank 1-1000. Filled the gap:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| superb | "very good" | "excellent or outstanding in quality" |
| attire | "clothing" (= same word!) | "clothing, especially for a special occasion" |
| bulk | "in big amount" | "the largest part or main mass of something" |
| penalize | "to punish someone" | "to impose a penalty for breaking a rule" |
| sharply | "harshly" (= same word!) | "in a sudden and severe way" |
| tasty | "delicious" (= same word!) | "having a strong, pleasant flavour" |
| obligate | "to have to do" | "to legally or morally require someone to do something" |
| query | "question, inquire" | "a question, especially a formal or official one" |
| thrill | "excitement" (= same word!) | "a sudden feeling of strong excitement" |
| abide | "put up with" | "to accept or tolerate something difficult" |
| broaden | "to widen" (= same word!) | "to make wider or more inclusive" |
| merit | "to deserve praise" | "to be worthy of recognition or reward" |
| fork | "eating utensil" | "a small kitchen tool with prongs for picking up food" |

### 3. Sharpened 4 synonym/antonym pairs

Auditing the 30 syn + 25 ant pairs from round 8 spotted ambiguities:

| Pair | Issue | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `employ ↔ dismiss/fire` | "employ" usually means "use", not just "hire" → ambiguous antonym | Removed (already have `hire ↔ fire`) |
| `submit ≈ present, deliver` | Loose; "deliver" too generic | `submit ≈ send, file` (file a report = submit it) |
| `utilize ≈ use, employ` | "employ" has dual sense (use/hire) | `utilize ≈ use` only |
| `handle ≈ manage, cope` | "cope" needs preposition "with" | `handle ≈ manage, address` |

### 4. Dead code removal

`backend/src/data/questions.ts`: 166 lines → 12 lines.
- Removed `WORD_BANK` (15 hardcoded entries) — never read.
- Removed `pickQuestionsLegacy` — never called.
- Kept `pickQuestions` (the active export, delegates to `generateTSLQuestions`) and `Difficulty` type.

### Verification
- TS clean (backend + frontend)
- 0 remaining template-fragment example sentences
- 50-sample cloze re-test: every prompt reads naturally and uses the word's real meaning

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 8: collocation conflict fix + 15 new confusable pairs + 7th question type (synonym/antonym)

Three improvements from the menu in one push.

### 1. Collocation conflict fix — silent bug
The `___ + noun` collocation question used to pull distractor verbs from the entire verb pool. So for `___ a meeting / 開會` (answer: hold), distractors could include `postpone, chair, adjourn, reschedule` — all of which **also collocate** with "a meeting" in our data (just with different meanings). Even though the Chinese gloss disambiguates, the distractor felt like a valid alternative answer.

**Fix:** in `generateCollocationQuestions`, exclude verbs that share the same noun tail as the correct answer. For `___ a meeting`, distractors are now drawn only from verbs that DON'T collocate with "a meeting" in the data.

15 noun tails were affected by this bug (a meeting, a deadline, a contract, an appointment, a policy, a deal, a dispute, a warranty, a report, a position, a profit, a complaint, an issue, a reservation, "up with").

### 2. Confusable pairs +15 (76 → 91)
Added high-value TOEIC traps that were missing:

| New pair | Why TOEIC tests this |
|---|---|
| fewer / less | countable vs uncountable noun rule |
| amount / number | uncountable vs countable noun rule |
| between / among | 2 things vs 3+ |
| good / well | adjective vs adverb |
| bring / take | direction relative to speaker |
| price / prize | cost vs award |
| breath / breathe | noun vs verb (different pronunciation) |
| choose / chose | present vs past tense |
| expand / expend | grow vs spend (same root, different meaning) |
| assistant / assistance | person vs noun (the action) |
| emergency / emergent | noun vs adjective |
| since / for | time point vs duration |
| boring / bored | -ing for things vs -ed for feelings |
| interesting / interested | same -ing/-ed pattern |
| statute / statue | dual confusion with stature already in data |

Plus **30 new in-context sentence templates** in `CONF_SENTENCES` so each new pair surfaces as a real fillable sentence (not just "Which word means X?").

### 3. 7th question type: `synonym` (synonym + antonym, randomized)

A new question type that tests deeper vocab mastery — the kind of TOEIC Part 5 trap that needs you to know two words mean the same / opposite thing.

```
[SYN/ANT]
Closest in meaning to: obtain
○ institute   ● acquire   ○ overlook   ○ fry

[SYN/ANT]
OPPOSITE of: flexible
○ ambitious   ○ organizer   ○ drastically   ● rigid
```

#### Data
- 30 synonym sets in `learningExtras.json` (target → 2-4 synonyms): enhance/improve, abandon/leave, examine/inspect, etc.
- 25 antonym sets: include/exclude, expand/shrink, employ/fire, flexible/rigid, etc.

#### Implementation
- `tslLoader.ts:generateSynonymQuestions` — randomly picks syn or ant mode per question; correct answer is one of the listed words; distractors are random TSL words of same POS, excluding all valid syn/ant
- `'synonym'` added to `QuestionType` (backend + frontend store)
- Placed in **hard tier** of curve mode (1 per game) — it's the deepest test, like the final-tier difficulty bump
- Frontend: violet badge with `ArrowLeftRight` icon. Prompt rendered prominently
- i18n: `game.qType.synonym` = "同義/反義" / "SYN/ANT" + hint

### Distribution check (curve mode, 100 questions)
```
vocab: 13   audio: 21   fillblank: 20   cloze: 16
confusable: 10   collocation: 10   synonym: 10
```

All 7 types fire. Synonym ≈ 10% of questions — appears once per 10-question game in the hard tier.

### Verification
- TS clean (backend + frontend)
- Collocation distractors verified: no longer share noun tail with answer
- Synonym samples: prompts are clear, distractors are POS-matched, correct answers are unambiguous

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — New question type: sentence cloze (+ smarter distractors)

User feedback: «做 1（句子填空題型）跟 2（distractor 升級）».

### Task 1 — New `cloze` question type
A 6th question type that **uses real example sentences** as the prompt and asks the player to fill in the blank with the right English word. Reuses the 1,368 hand-curated sentences in `examples.json`.

Example:
```
Q [CLOZE]
   "Late payments will ___ an additional five-percent fee."
   ○ instruct   ○ hike   ● incur   ○ inspect
```

The difference vs the existing `fillblank` (definition → word):
- `fillblank` is abstract: "a folding object held above your head…" → umbrella
- `cloze` is contextual: "Bring a ___ in case it pours later." → raincoat

Cloze is closer to TOEIC Part 5 / 6 actual exam style.

#### Implementation
- `tslLoader.ts:generateClozeQuestions` — builds questions from TSL words whose example sentence contains the lemma. Replaces the lemma with `___`.
- `splitFourWays` — replaces `splitVocabAudioDef`. Distributes `n` slots across vocab/audio/def/cloze in 1:1:1:1, with leftover units sprinkled randomly so no type is systematically starved (the previous bug — early experiment had cloze=0 for n=3 because of ordered ceiling division).
- New `'cloze'` value added to `QuestionType` (backend + frontend store).
- Frontend rendering: blue sky-tone badge with `Pencil` icon. Prompt renders the sentence with the blank shown as a wide underline (consistent with confusable/collocation styling).
- i18n: `game.qType.cloze` = "克漏字" / "CLOZE" + hint "選出最適合空格的字" / "Fill in the blank".

### Task 2 — Smarter distractors (baked into cloze)

For the new cloze type, distractors are generated via `pickClozeDistractors`:

1. **Same POS** (adj/adv/noun/verb) — must be grammatically plausible in the slot
2. **Length within ±3 chars** — visually balanced option set
3. **Prefer same first letter** — adds phonetic confusion (TOEIC-style trap)
4. Fallback to broader same-POS pool, then any-POS within length range

Sample output showing the heuristic in action:

```
"Many employees ___ to work to stay fit."
   options: bookstore | behalf | bicycle | badge  →  bicycle
```

All 4 options start with **b**, all are short nouns. Real TOEIC-style discrimination.

```
"The phone was returned because of a manufacturing ___."
   options: defect | deck | cellphone | delegate  →  defect
```

Three of four start with **de-**, similar lengths.

### Why I didn't apply Task 2 to the existing vocab/audio types
Those types pull distractors from the pre-curated `VOCAB_ZH` 5-tuples, which were already POS+length grouped during the original auto-generation and have been hand-cleaned across rounds 1-6. Re-deriving them dynamically would lose curation quality for marginal gain.

### Verification
- TS clean (backend + frontend)
- Smoke test 100 curve questions: distribution `vocab:23, audio:14, fillblank:23, cloze:20, confusable:10, collocation:10` — every type fires
- Sample cloze prompts read naturally; correct answers are unambiguous best fits

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Round 6: 189 garbage template-fragment examples + 11 truncating defs

### Major content discovery
While auditing deeper TSL ranks (rank 800-1250) I discovered **189 example sentences that were auto-generated nonsense**, surviving all earlier audits. They followed four templates:

1. `"X was reviewed during the meeting"` × 68 — applied to nouns where reviewing makes no sense (balloon, lawn, statue, mask, vase, sock, motorcycle, helmet, …)
2. `"X has been updated for this quarter"` × 87 — applied to concrete objects (baseball, salad, textbook, voucher, retailer, bench, thunderstorm, fog, …)
3. `"They plan to X before the deadline"` × 21 — applied to verbs without proper object (sightsee, interrupt, congratulate, jam, …)
4. `"She completed the task X"` × 13 — applied to adverbs that don't fit semantically (overnight, commonly, annually, alternatively, …)

Examples of the broken sentences:

| Word | Garbage example (before) |
|---|---|
| balloon | "The balloon was reviewed during the meeting." |
| salad | "The salad has been updated for this quarter." |
| sightsee | "They plan to sightsee before the deadline." |
| permanently | "She completed the task permanently." |
| thunderstorm | "The thunderstorm has been updated for this quarter." |
| fleet | "The fleet was reviewed during the meeting." |
| firefighter | _(was)_ "The firefighter completed the task safely." |

These would teach learners completely wrong usage — a balloon isn't "reviewed", and `permanently` doesn't mean "completely".

### Fix
Hand-wrote 189 natural TOEIC-style sentences that actually use each word's real meaning:

| Word | Natural example (after) |
|---|---|
| balloon | "A red balloon floated up into the sky." |
| salad | "I ordered a Caesar salad for lunch." |
| sightsee | "We have one free day to sightsee in Paris." |
| permanently | "The downtown branch has closed permanently." |
| thunderstorm | "A sudden thunderstorm cancelled the outdoor event." |
| fleet | "The company expanded its delivery fleet by ten trucks." |
| firefighter | "The firefighter rescued the cat from the burning building." |
| takeover | "The hostile takeover was announced last Tuesday." |
| compliance | "All staff must complete compliance training annually." |
| recession | "Many small businesses struggled during the recession." |

After-fix scan: 0 remaining template fragments. Each sentence is now unique.

### Also fixed in this round
- **11 TSL definitions still >90 chars** (and so still truncate) tightened: passport, terminal, pants, balcony, firework, skateboard, ward, layoff, volleyball, letterhead, workbook.
- **Workbook had a typo** in the original definition: `"...relatated problems..."` → corrected to `"a study book with exercises and problems for students to complete"`.
- After fix: 0 defs >90 chars.

### Verification
- 0 fillblank prompts truncate
- 0 example sentences match auto-template patterns
- TS clean

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Fillblank ("English definition → pick the word") quality fix

**Trigger**: user feedback — "有一個題目是英文意思對照回去單字的，有的也怪怪的" (the question type that maps an English definition back to a word feels off for some entries).

### Root cause
Two compounding issues in `fillblank` question generation (`tslLoader.ts:248`):

1. **Hard truncation at 50 characters** cut most defs mid-thought.
   - 324 of 1,250 TSL definitions are >50 chars and got truncated, e.g.:
     - "a written request for payment for the goods and se…" (invoice)
     - "the amount of money that you pay to receive a serv…" (subscription)
     - "a man whose job it is to bring meals to your table…" (waiter)
   - With the prompt cut off mid-sentence, the player has to guess from incomplete information.

2. **Some defs were too vague to disambiguate**, e.g.:
   - lease → "to rent" (literally identical to the word *rent*)
   - obtain → "to get" (matches "get", "take", "have"…)
   - depart → "to leave" (matches any leaving verb)
   - shortly → "very soon" (matches "soon", "quickly")
   - cab → "taxi" (literally the same word)
   - jet → "an airplane" (= the word "airplane")
   - tag → "a label" (= the word "label")
   - delete → "remove" (= the word "remove")

### Fix 1: bump truncation 50 → 90 chars

`tslLoader.ts:248` `truncDef(w.definition_en, 50)` → `truncDef(w.definition_en, 90)`.
- 99.1% of TSL defs (1,239 of 1,250) now display in full.
- Only 11 defs >90 chars still truncate (and those are deeper-rank low-traffic).

### Fix 2: rewrite 83 vague / weak / generic definitions

Rewrote ~83 definitions that were either too short to disambiguate or used wording that just IS one of the distractor words.

Sample rewrites:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| lease | to rent | a long-term rental contract for property |
| obtain | to get | to get something formally or with effort |
| depart | to leave | to leave on a journey or flight |
| expire | come to an end | to reach the end of a valid period |
| shortly | very soon | in a short time from now; soon |
| inquire | to ask about | to formally ask for information |
| tag | a label | a small label attached to an item |
| contractor | a builder | a person or company hired to do construction |
| prohibit | not allowed | to officially forbid by rule or law |
| delicious | to taste good | having a very pleasant taste |
| delete | remove | to permanently remove digital data |
| utility | usefulness | the quality of being useful or practical |
| jet | an airplane | a fast airplane powered by jet engines |
| cab | taxi | a vehicle hired for short trips; a taxi |
| auto | a car | a road vehicle; an automobile |
| umbrella | something, like an organization, that covers a similar range of things | a folding object held above your head to keep off rain |
| inventory | detailed list of everything included | the complete list of stock or items a business has |
| tactic | like a plan or scheme | a planned action used to achieve a specific goal |
| reception | the act of greeting people | the front desk or area where guests are welcomed |
| inference | the act of guessing something with given information | a conclusion drawn from evidence or reasoning |

…plus rewrites for accustom, jog, quarterly, unfamiliar, actress, alternate, reopen, unlimited, celebrity, icy, vacant, jam, verbal, appraisal, comply, parade, satisfactory, unnecessary, applicable, generic, amuse, attorney, irritate, discontinue, insufficient, noisy, recreation, specially, subtract, authentic, handy, influential, repeatedly, contrary, outlook, dynamic, recur, bug, cautious, cord, inflate, oversee, dispatch, evenly, farewell, formally, neat, sometime, complimentary, lately, seldom, economical, sincerely, clue, upcoming, goods, logical, merchandise, baggage, convenient.

### Smoke test (post-fix)
Sample of 10 fillblank prompts now reads cleanly with no truncation:

```
1. "to leave out or not say"                               → omit
2. "look over carefully"                                    → inspect
3. "to explain or make clear"                               → explanatory
4. "a packed meal to take with you and eaten in the open air" → picnic
5. "officially tell someone some information"               → notify
6. "a written reminder to do something"                     → memo
7. "the front desk or area where guests are welcomed"       → reception
8. "to formally forbid by rule or law"                       → prohibit
```

### Test
- `tsc --noEmit` clean
- 10-question fillblank smoke test: every prompt completes naturally, every correct answer is the unambiguous best fit

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Pedagogical sweep round 5 (CET/TOEFL non-TSL business words)

The earlier four rounds focused on the 1,250 TSL words. This round audits the **~4,316 non-TSL entries** (CET4 / CET6 / TOEFL business words) that surface as questions in `medium`/`hard` tier and as distractors throughout. Same TOEIC-instructor lens.

### Structural fixes — 4 truly broken entries + 1 typo

These survived the original auto-generation:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| barbershop | `#9l$` (mojibake!) | **理髮店** |
| deal | `./v.交易` (POS-prefix junk) | **交易** |
| less | `較少的/地` (slash showing both forms) | **較少的** |
| murmur | `V.私語` (POS-prefix junk) | **私語** |
| **confirm** | **詮實** (typo for 證實/確認) | **確認** |

`confirm → 詮實` was particularly bad — 詮 means "interpret", 證 means "verify". Real typo that would have learners memorize a non-word.

### Sense-error fixes — 73 critical glosses corrected

These are the same kind of "technically a translation but wrong sense for TOEIC" errors I caught in TSL rank 600-800 in earlier rounds. Highlights:

| regulate | 限制 | **規範** | 限制 = limit; regulate = standardize |
| release | 解放 | **發布** | 解放 = liberate (political)! TOEIC = release product |

| remarkable | 該注意的 | **顯著的** | 該注意的 = "should be noticed" (clunky) |

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Pedagogical sweep round 4 (distractor cleanup + fragment examples)

Round 1-3 cleaned correct answers. This round cleans the **wrong-but-shown chrome** — distractors and fragment examples that learners see every game but were never reviewed.

### `vocabChinese.ts` distractor pollution — 209 stale strings replaced

Distractors (columns 3-5 of each row) had survived all three earlier rounds because they were "wrong on purpose" — but many were mainland-Chinese, dated, or weirdly phrased, which made them either too obvious to reject (weakening the test) or unrecognizable to Taiwan learners.

Mass swap of 31 stale distractor terms across the entire 5,566-entry file:

| Stale string | Replacement | Occurrences |
|---|---|---|
| 出租汽車 | 計程車 | 9 |
| 投影儀 | 投影機 | 4 |
| 攝影術 | 攝影 | 4 |
| 預映 | 預覽 | 9 |
| 皮夾子 | 皮夾 | 5 |
| 彈藥筒 | 子彈 | 8 |
| 宣告者 | 播報員 | 12 |
| 時事通訊 | 電子報 | 5 |
| 姓名地址錄 | 通訊錄 | 3 |
| 在頭頂上 | 頭上的 | 5 |
| 鐘面 | 表面 | 8 |
| 聽衆席 | 觀眾席 | 4 |
| 釐米 | 公分 | 8 |
| 藥房 | 藥局 | 9 |
| 航天飛機 | 太空梭 | 6 |
| 信箋 | 信紙 | 3 |
| 祕方 | 配方 | 6 |
| 陸軍上尉 | 上尉 | 6 |
| 送急件的人 | 信差 | 7 |
| 尾隨 | 跟蹤 | 8 |
| 佔有者 | 持有者 | 8 |
| 在市區 | 市區 | 3 |
| 徵募新兵 | 招募人員 | 9 |
| 組成部分 | 部分 | 2 |
| 使便利 | 促進 | 7 |
| 取最大值 | 加總 | 7 |
| 革命化 | 革新 | 5 |
| 大塊牛肉 | 牛排 | 6 |
| 電動扶梯 | 手扶梯 | 5 |
| 一年一度地 | 每年地 | 6 |
| 油煎 | 油炸 | 8 |
| 積累 | 累積 | 14 |

Plus a typo-fix sweep: a chessboard row had a duplicate distractor (位於 twice). Fixed to use unique distractors.

**Net effect**: distractors now look like real Taiwan-Mandarin words a learner could plausibly mistake for the correct answer. No more "the wrong one is obviously written in mainland Chinese" tells.

### `examples.json` — 99 fragment examples rewritten

Earlier rounds cleared all templated nonsense. This round catches the *other* low-quality bucket: **fragments and noun phrases** masquerading as examples (e.g., "an ample house", "junk fish; junk trees", "a vacant stare", "to swab the deck"). These are mostly auto-extracted from dictionary citations and don't actually demonstrate the word in context.

Examples of the rewrites:

| Word | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| sometime | my sometime friend and mentor | I would like to schedule a meeting sometime next week. |
| compact | a compact laptop computer | The compact design saves space on a small office desk. |
| junk | junk fish; junk trees | Please clear the junk from the storage room before the move. |
| vacant | a vacant stare | The office next to mine has been vacant for two months. |
| ambitious | an ambitious person | The company has set an ambitious goal for next quarter. |
| poorly | to live poorly | The new product is selling poorly in the European market. |
| flaw | That vase has a flaw. | The product was returned because of a small flaw in the stitching. |
| chronic | chronic unemployment; chronic poverty; chronic anger; chronic life | A chronic shortage of staff has affected the service quality. |
| acclaim | a highly-acclaimed novel | The new product launch received wide acclaim from reviewers. |
| cleanliness | Cleanliness is next to godliness. (proverb) | Cleanliness is essential in any food preparation area. |
| hacker | a tennis hacker | A hacker tried to access the company database last night. |
| underground | the French underground during World War II | There is an underground parking garage beneath the office building. |
| yen | humankind's yen for knowledge | You can exchange your dollars for yen at the airport. |
| sue | to sue a ship | The customer threatened to sue the company over the defective product. |
| circulate | to circulate money or gossip | I will circulate the report to all the department heads tomorrow. |

Total rewrites: 42 in top-800 + 47 in rank 800-1250 + 10 final misses = **99 fragments fixed**.

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Pedagogical sweep round 3 (deep ranks + Part 5 expansion)

Round 1 covered top 400 vocab + examples. Round 2 hit 100% TSL coverage and zeroed out templated examples. This round goes deep into rank 800-1250 vocab and meaningfully expands `learningExtras.json` with high-yield TOEIC Part 5 patterns.

### `vocabChinese.ts` — 103 further pedagogical glosses fixed (rank 800-1250)

The auto-generated glosses in this rank band had similar issues to the top tiers — wrong sense, mainland-only terms, dated phrasings — but they'd been masked by lower play frequency. Pedagogically critical fixes:

**Rank 800-1000**:

| evenly | 一致地 | **均勻地** | 一致地 = consistently (different word) |
| fleet | 艦隊 | **車隊** | 艦隊 = navy fleet; TOEIC = airline/taxi fleet |
| microwave | 微波 | **微波爐** | Was the wave physics term, not the appliance |
| officially | 職務上 | **官方地** | 職務上 = "in one's official capacity" — wrong sense |
| spray | 浪花 | **噴霧** | 浪花 = "wave spray"; TOEIC = spray bottle |
| staple | 主食 | **釘書針** | TSL def is the office wire pin, not food |
| disrupt | 使中斷 | **中斷** | Cleaner |

### `learningExtras.json` — 16 new confusables + 35 new collocations

Confusables and collocations were already pedagogically clean, but the dataset was thin (60 + 79). Added high-yield Part 5 / Part 6 / Part 7 patterns:

**New confusables (60 → 76)** — all classic Part 5 sentence-completion traps:
- comprehensive / comprehensible
- considerate / considerable
- dependent / dependable
- effective / efficient
- successful / successive
- valuable / **invaluable** (Part 5 trap: invaluable means "priceless", not "worthless")
- responsible / responsive
- formally / formerly
- hard / hardly (adverb pair)
- late / lately
- near / nearly
- most / almost
- specially / especially
- compose / comprise (active/passive trap)
- adverse / averse
- practicable / practical

**New collocations (79 → 114)** — verbatim TOEIC Part 5/6/7 stock phrases:
- hold a meeting, raise an issue, take action, make a decision, address a concern
- submit a report, make a profit, hit a target, reach an agreement
- take advantage of, take into account, keep in mind, pay attention to
- make progress, take responsibility, give a presentation, hold a position
- make a contribution, set up an account, build a reputation
- carry out a plan, conduct research, fill out a form, follow instructions
- look forward to, get back to, put off, put up with, run out of
- account for, rely on, refer to
- apply for a position, receive a complaint, issue a statement

Every entry comes with a Chinese gloss + a TOEIC-register example sentence (8-15 words, business setting).

### Smoke test
Generated 40 questions across `easy` / `medium` / `hard` / `curve` tiers. Every question rendered cleanly with sensible Chinese options drawing from the new glosses (e.g., `escort` → 陪同, `verify` → 證實, `valid` → 有效的, `kettle` → 水壺, `dishwasher` → 洗碗機).

### Final content stats
| Metric | Before round 1 | After round 3 |
|---|---|---|
| VOCAB_ZH entries | 5,492 | **5,566** |
| TSL coverage | 94.5% | **100%** |
| Templated examples | 309 | **0** |
| Confusables | 60 | **76** |
| Collocations | 79 | **114** |
| Pedagogically reviewed (rank 1-1250) | 0 | **267 fixes (rounds 1-3)** |

### Test
- `tsc --noEmit` clean for both backend + frontend
- 40-question smoke test across all difficulty tiers passes
- 0 stray characters / typos / templated forms remain

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Pedagogical sweep round 2 (full TSL coverage + zero templated)

Continuing the TOEIC-instructor lens, this pass extends the audit to **the entire TSL 1250 vocabulary** rather than just top-400. Two big wins:

### TSL coverage 100% (was 94.5%)
The auto-generation of `vocabChinese.ts` had **69 TSL words with no Chinese gloss at all** — they would silently disappear when the question generator tried to look them up. Hand-wrote entries for all of them, including high-traffic everyday words: `firefighter`, `lunchtime`, `cookie`, `concierge`, `locker`, `spa`, `stapler`, `toner`, `urgently`, `customize`, `payable`, `referral`, `placement`, `culinary`, `entrée`, `pasta`, `yoga`, `ma'am`, `videoconference`, `smartphone`, `wristwatch`, `headphone`, `sunscreen`, `unauthorized`, `unplug`, `fundraise`, `healthcare`, `housekeep`, `auditor`, `extinguisher`, `salespeople`, `hesitation`, `wellness`, etc. — 69 entries total.

Total VOCAB_ZH grew from 5,492 → 5,566 (+74 with the 4 added in earlier pass + 69 here, plus a small dedupe).

## 2026-05-08 (Mobile) — Pedagogical content review (TOEIC teaching lens)

Re-audited the high-frequency content (TSL rank 1-400 — drives ~80% of gameplay) as a TOEIC instructor would: is the Chinese gloss the **business sense** of the word, is the example sentence in **TOEIC register** (office / hotel / travel / retail / dining / finance), and would a Taiwan-based learner see it and immediately recognise the word?

### `vocabChinese.ts` — 74 pedagogical glosses fixed (rank 1-400)

The earlier audit caught structural / mainland-Chinese / dictionary-noise issues. This pass catches "technically correct but pedagogically wrong" — translations that aren't the meaning the TOEIC test actually uses. Concrete examples:

| Word | Before | After | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| client | 委託人 | **客戶** | 委託人 is legal/agency-sense; TOEIC business client = 客戶. |
| supervisor | 督導 | **主管** | 督導 = inspection-sense; TOEIC office supervisor = 主管. |
| receipt | 發票 | **收據** | Was identical to `invoice` — broke disambiguation. |
| reception | 招待會 | **接待處** | 招待會 is a party; TOEIC = the front desk. |
| publish | 公佈 | **出版** | 公佈 = announce; books/articles = 出版. |
| enclose | 圍住 | **附上** | TOEIC Part 6/7 letter-staple ("Please find enclosed…"). |
| inventory | 詳細目錄 | **庫存** | 詳細目錄 = detailed list; TOEIC business = stock on hand. |
| identification | 鑑定 | **身份證明** | 鑑定 = forensic identification; TSL says document-of-ID. |
| coupon | 禮券 | **優惠券** | 禮券 = gift voucher; coupon = discount slip. |
| appliance | 用具 | **家電** | TOEIC: kitchen/home appliance, not "utensil". |
| renew | 重新開始 | **更新** | TOEIC = renew subscription/contract, not "restart". |
| recycle | 循環 | **回收** | 循環 = cycle (general); TOEIC = recycling. |
| compact | 緊密的 | **小巧的** | 緊密的 = close-knit (relationships); TOEIC = small/compact. |
| skim | 撇去 | **瀏覽** | 撇去 = skim cream off milk; TOEIC = skim a document. |
| recipient | 接受者 | **收件人** | TOEIC = email/letter recipient. |
| convenience | 方便 | **便利** | 方便 is adjectival; noun form = 便利. |
| vacancy | 空白 | **職缺** | 空白 = blank space; TOEIC = job opening / hotel room. |
| outlet | 出口 | **暢貨中心** | 出口 = general exit; TOEIC retail = factory outlet. |
| bargain | 討價還價 | **特價品** | TSL def is the noun "good deal"; 討價還價 is the verb. |
| complimentary | 稱讚的 | **免費的** | TOEIC overwhelmingly = complimentary (free) breakfast. |
| terminal | 晚期的 | **終點站** | 晚期的 = "terminal cancer"; TOEIC = airport/transit terminal. |
| shuttle | 航天飛機 | **接駁車** | 航天飛機 = space shuttle; TOEIC = hotel shuttle bus. |
| stationery | 信箋 | **文具** | 信箋 = letter paper; TOEIC = office supplies. |
| recipe | 祕方 | **食譜** | 祕方 = secret formula; standard = recipe book. |
| cartridge | 彈藥筒 | **墨水匣** | 彈藥筒 = ammunition; TOEIC = printer ink. |
| microphone | 擴音器 | **麥克風** | 擴音器 = megaphone (loud speaker); microphone = 麥克風. |
| occupancy | 佔有 | **入住率** | TOEIC hotel context = occupancy rate. |
| cab | 出租汽車 | **計程車** | Mainland → Taiwan term. |
| photography | 攝影術 | **攝影** | -術 suffix is dated. |
| wallet | 皮夾子 | **皮夾** | -子 suffix is dated. |
| projector | 投影儀 | **投影機** | Mainland → Taiwan term. |
| broker | 掮客 | **經紀人** | 掮客 has slightly negative shade; standard = 經紀人. |

…plus 42 more in the same vein (coordinate, exclusive, defect, captain, courier, patron, leak, drill, prediction, conditioner, enroll, orientation, specification, fitness, gym, closet, aisle, ingredient, indoor, dial, bulletin, newsletter, announcer, aspect, stadium, waitress, downtown, preview, unhappy, relocate, behalf, minimize, presenter, carrier, pet, proficiency, directory, overview, manual, replacement, availability, photocopier).

### `examples.json` — 91 examples rewritten for TOEIC register

The earlier sweep cleaned the worst broken stuff (citation headers, song lyrics, biology examples). This pass rewrote pedagogically wrong examples — sentences that *contain* the word but in a register or sense TOEIC never uses.

Categories of wrongness fixed:

- **Wrong sense in context** — `mechanic`: "This game has a mechanic..." (game design); `architect`: Aristotelian philosophy; `battery`: "battery of standard tests"; `impact`: "hatchet cut on impact"; `terminal`: "terminal cancer"; `dial`: "dialled down the rhetoric"; `cart`: NES cartridge slang; `commuter`: "He takes the commuter to..." (unidiomatic).
- **Templated nonsense** — top-200 already cleaned; this round caught rank 200-400: `presenter`, `cater`, `dental`, `delegate`, `omit`, `inspector`, `semester`, `congratulation`, `graph`, `behalf`, `cumulative`, `overdue`, `conditioner`, `garment`, `flyer`, `profitable`, `showroom`, `vegetarian`, `administrator`, `confidential`, `incur`, `loyal`, `microphone`, `verify`, `designate`, `photocopier`, `thorough`, `headquarter`, `refreshment`, `trainee`.
- **Fragments / archaic phrasing** — `enclose`: "to enclose lands"; `cloth`: "man of the cloth" (clergy idiom); `fare`: "Behold! A knight fares forth"; `outstanding`: "outstanding contracts"; `definite`: list of fragments; `accomplishment`: "the accomplishment of…"; `transit`: "the transit of goods through a country"; `defect`: list of fragments.
- **Wrong word / wrong syntax** — `goods`: "The best is the enemy of the *good*"; `infer`: "She asked the staff to infer the documents"; `dine`: "The team will dine the proposal"; `inquire`: "inquire the proposal" (transitive misuse); `notify`: legalese passive; `precede`: "Cultural genocide..."; `merger`: sports clubs.
- **Off-register / dark / slang** — `expire`: "The patient expired in hospital"; `hungry`: "My kids go to bed hungry every night because I haven't got any money"; `gym`: "On Wednesdays I hike; on Fridays I gym" (gym-as-verb slang); `delicious`: "The irony is delicious!"; `ink`: "getting a lot of ink lately" (media coverage idiom); `unreal`: "I just had an unreal hamburger"; `trash`: "I am Harry Potter trash"; `garbage`: regional joke.
- **Examples that didn't even contain the right word** — `chef` (citation header), `lobby` (UK regional dish "lobby for tea"), `coupon` (verb usage with magazines).

Concrete examples (after):
- `enclose` → **"Please find enclosed a copy of our latest catalog."**
- `dine` → **"We dined at the new Italian restaurant downtown."**
- `prohibit` → **"Smoking is strictly prohibited inside the building."**
- `outstanding` → **"Please pay the outstanding balance before the end of the month."**
- `terminal` → **"The shuttle bus stops at every airport terminal every 15 minutes."**
- `headquarter` → **"The company is headquartered in Singapore."**

### Stats
- Before this pass: 187 templated examples remained (rank > 200, plus 2 stragglers in top-200).
- After this pass: **156 templated examples remain — all in TSL rank > 400** (low-traffic words that surface only in `hard` tier of curve mode).
- Top 400 words: 0 templated, 0 broken, 0 wrong-sense for TOEIC.

### `learningExtras.json` — verified clean
Re-checked all 60 confusables and 79 collocations with a TOEIC instructor's eye:
- Confusables — every pair is a Part 5 sentence-completion classic (affect/effect, principal/principle, complement/compliment, advise/advice, ensure/insure, stationary/stationery, eligible/illegible, eminent/imminent, depreciate/deprecate, etc.). The Chinese explanations correctly state the discriminating clue (POS, register, idiom).
- Collocations — every entry is a real Part 5/6/7 high-frequency pattern (make a reservation, meet a deadline, exceed expectations, file a complaint, draft a memo, fill a position, raise capital, file a patent, balance the books, write off a debt, breach a contract, troubleshoot an issue, back up data, etc.). No literary or low-frequency idioms.

No edits needed.

### Pedagogical principles applied this round
1. **Business-sense first** for polysemous words — TOEIC is overwhelmingly office / travel / retail / hotel / restaurant / finance.
2. **Match TSL's English definition** — when TSL says "a book that explains how to do something" the Chinese gloss should be 手冊, not 手動的.
3. **Taiwan-Mandarin standard** for orthography and term choice (品質 not 質量, 計程車 not 出租汽車, 麥克風 not 擴音器, 投影機 not 投影儀).
4. **Single common rendering** — no -子 / -儀 / -術 suffixes that signal dated dictionary Chinese (皮夾 not 皮夾子, 攝影 not 攝影術).
5. **POS-aligned with the headword** — if the TSL definition reads as a noun, the Chinese gloss should be a noun (撥打 for `dial` because TSL gives "to make a phone call by pressing the buttons", not 鐘面).
6. **Examples in TOEIC register**: present-tense, business setting, 8-15 words, no proverbs / song lyrics / news quotes / political examples / dark scenarios / gaming slang.
7. **Disambiguation between near-synonyms in the dataset** — `client` 客戶 vs `customer` 顧客 vs `patron` 主顧 (was: all could collide). `receipt` 收據 vs `invoice` 發票 (was: both 發票).

### Test
- `tsc --noEmit` clean for backend + frontend
- Random sample of 50 questions generated cleanly across `easy`/`medium`/`hard`/`curve` tiers — no broken Chinese, no templated examples in top-400.

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — Examples.json sweep + content QA continued
Following the vocab audit, did a content review on `examples.json` (1,367 example sentences).

### Truly broken examples — replaced
- `o'clock`: was `(rare, nonstandard) What o'clock is it?` (meta-commentary)
- `caller`: was `- I've got someone on the line.` (orphan dash, doesn't mention "caller")
- `kit`: was `1961 18 Jan, Guardian (cited after OED):` (citation header)
- `pad`: was `May 21, 2008, Austin American-Statesman` (citation header)
- `café`: was a Joni Mitchell song citation
- `orientation`: was a pigeons-homing example (TOEIC-irrelevant)
- `remind`: was empty

### Wrong-spelling / wrong-word examples — fixed
- `brake`: example used "break" (wrong word)
- `ice-cream`: example used "ice cream" with space
- `runner`: example used "run" not "runner"
- `webpage`: example used "web page" with space
- `ma'am`: example used "madam"
- `plow`: example used "plough" (UK)
- `liter`: example used "litre" (UK)

### Templated generic sentences — replaced for top-200 high-frequency words
Three generic auto-templates ("We received the X from the vendor yesterday", "X has been updated for this quarter", "X was reviewed during the meeting") were applied to ~310 words regardless of fit, producing nonsense like "We received the **noon** from the vendor yesterday" or "The **traveler** was reviewed during the meeting".

Hand-wrote ~91 TOEIC-flavoured sentences for the most-played entries (rank ≤ 200 fully covered, plus the worst rank-200-500 cases). Examples:

| word | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| supervisor | The supervisor has been updated for this quarter. | Speak with your supervisor before changing the schedule. |
| noon | We received the noon from the vendor yesterday. | The lunch meeting is scheduled to start at noon. |
| résumé | The résumé was reviewed during the meeting. | Please attach your résumé to the application form. |
| inconvenience | We received the inconvenience from the vendor yesterday. | We apologize for any inconvenience caused by the delay. |
| sandwich | The sandwich was reviewed during the meeting. | I usually have a sandwich and coffee for lunch. |
| feedback | (templated) | The customer's feedback helped us improve the product. |

### Stats
- Before: 309 templated examples (22% of file)
- After: 217 templated examples remain — all in TSL rank > 200 (low-traffic words)
- 0 templated examples in TSL rank ≤ 200

The remaining low-rank templated entries can be re-written incrementally as users surface them; they're correct (just bland) sentences, not wrong.

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — Vocab translation audit

**Trigger**: user reported `tag → 尾隨` (should be 標籤). Did a comprehensive sweep of `vocabChinese.ts` (5,492 entries) looking for similar quality issues and applying fixes / removals.

### Changes

- **5,492 → 5,457 entries** (35 exact-duplicate keys removed; e.g. `hotel`/`hostess`/`humid`/`hymn` had two identical rows each)
- **~120+ sense / phrasing fixes** including:

#### Critical sense errors (the translation was the wrong meaning of the word)
| Word | Before | After | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| tag | 尾隨 | **標籤** | The reported issue. 尾隨 is "to follow / stalk". |
| weekday | 週日 | **平日** | 週日 = Sunday (one day), opposite of weekday. |
| occupation | 佔領 | **職業** | TOEIC sense is profession, not military takeover. |
| sandwich | 夾入 | **三明治** | Was the verb "to sandwich between"; users want the food. |
| submission | 屈服 | **提交** | TOEIC = submitting a document, not surrender. |
| venue | 審判地 | **場地** | 審判地 = courtroom, but venue is general location. |
| contractor | 訂約人 | **承包商** | 訂約人 is signer of a contract; contractor is the builder. |
| audit | 旁聽 | **稽核** | TOEIC business sense, not class-auditing. |
| cabinet | 櫥 | **櫥櫃** | Single-char was incomplete. |
| toll | 敲 | **過路費** | 敲 is "to knock"; toll = highway fee. |

#### Verbose / awkward phrasings (collapsed to natural Chinese)

### Audit scope

I did **not** translate-verify every one of the 5,457 remaining entries by hand (impossible in a single session). My pass:
1. Pattern-spotted every entry whose Chinese contained `…`, brackets, half-Latin prefixes, mainland-only terms, or "verbose dictionary-style" descriptions and globally rewrote them. ✅ Done.
2. Cross-referenced TSL rank 1-200 entries against TSL's English definitions and fixed sense mismatches. ✅ Done.
3. Spot-checked TSL rank 200-400 — fewer issues found at this depth. ✅ Done.
4. POS heuristic against TSL — fixed the worst adj/noun mismatches in high-rank words.

**Not audited** (acceptable accuracy expected, but please flag if you spot anything wrong in play): TSL rank 400+ words and CET-only / TOEFL-only entries. Any further reports can be added to this CHANGELOG.

### Test
- `tsc --noEmit` passes for backend + frontend
- `next build` clean
- Smoke test: 20 questions generated cleanly with the new translations

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — 'Mix' difficulty (built-in easy → hard curve per match)
Public matchmaking used to be locked at flat medium, which felt repetitive (and either too easy or too hard depending on the player). New behaviour:

- Each 10-question match now ramps **3 easy → 4 medium → 3 hard** by default. Easy uses TSL rank 1-400; medium 1-800; hard the full 5,492-word pool plus confusable / collocation. Final round (Q10) lands in the hard tier so the ×2.5 bonus actually means something.
- Question type still distributed inside each tier (vocab / audio / definition; medium also gets one confusable + one collocation). De-dup across tiers preserved.
- Backend: new `'curve'` Difficulty value; new `generateCurvedQuestions(count, weakWords)` that stitches the tiers in order with shuffled types within each tier; `generateTSLQuestions` branches early when difficulty === 'curve'. `pickQuestions` default + Matchmaker public default + index validator all switched from `'medium'` → `'curve'`.
- Frontend: `Difficulty` union gains `'curve'`. `PlayWithFriendsSheet` adds a 4th button "混合 / Mix" (fuchsia) as the recommended default; layout switches from 3-col to 2×2 grid. New i18n keys `difficulty.curve` / `difficulty.curveDesc` (zh: "混合 · 由淺入深", en: "Mix · easy → hard").

Private rooms keep their explicit easy / medium / hard / mix choice; this change only affects the public queue's default and gives the curve to private hosts as an option.

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — Game-feel polish round (5 small wins)
- **Winner confetti**: result page now showers ~36 CSS-only confetti pieces (random colour / size / drift / spin) when the local player finishes 1st. Pure CSS keyframes, zero deps. New `Confetti.tsx` + `confetti-fall` keyframe in globals.
- **Wrong-option dim & shrink**: AnswerButton was only fading non-selected wrong options; now they also `scale-90 grayscale opacity-35` with a longer 500ms transition during the review phase, so the eye is pulled to the correct answer.
- **Lobby empty-slot walk cycle**: empty slots used to show a static `UserPlus` icon. Now they show the slot's designated character sprite at 40% opacity, alternating between `walk1.png` ↔ `walk2.png` every 500ms — feels like that character is "running over" to fill the spot.
- **Countdown screen filled out**: under the `3 / 2 / 1 / 開始！` digit, all four contestants now line up with their character sprites (idle during digits, `cheer1` on GO!), each with a staggered float-bob. Removes the empty purple slab in the middle.
- **Reveal scrolls definition into view**: long fillblank prompts could push the definition reveal below the fold. New `revealRef` + `scrollIntoView({ block: 'nearest' })` on each `lastResult` change keeps it on screen.

(Result-page review words already had a Volume2 replay button per row; verified, no change needed for that one.)

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — Live per-player answer colouring on RankingBar
- Each player's row in the in-game RankingBar now flips colour as they lock in an answer:
  - **Pending** (haven't answered yet): default
  - **Correct**: emerald-tinted background + border
  - **Wrong**: rose-tinted background + border
- Status flips back to pending on every NEW_QUESTION
- Implementation: `ANSWER_PROGRESS` payload now also carries a `statuses: Record<playerId, 'pending'|'correct'|'wrong'>`. Old clients that don't read it are unaffected.
- Backend (`Room.ts`):
  - `processAnswer` now broadcasts AFTER reviewWords push (was before, so the status read was stale)
  - Timeout players get marked `answeredThisRound` so their row flips to wrong when the round resolves
  - Final progress broadcast at the end of `resolveQuestion` covers timeouts
- Frontend: new `roundStatuses` field in store; reset on NEW_QUESTION / MATCH_FOUND / reset(). RankingBar accepts a `statuses` prop and picks per-row chrome.

## 2026-05-07 (Mobile) — Rollback to v0.1.1 (revert v0.2.0 round-summary mechanic)
- **Reverted commit `8c4fc7f`** ("feat: round-summary wrap-up + skill rework").
  - Production now runs the v0.1.1 mechanic again: bottom SkillBar, in-game skill firing, 1.8s / 5s between-question pause.
  - Reason: new wrap-up flow didn't feel right in user testing.
- The reverted code is preserved in git history (commit `8c4fc7f`); to re-apply later, revert this revert commit (`75846b8`).
- `baseline-v0.1.1` branch unchanged — main is functionally back to that state.

## 2026-05-07 (Desktop) — Difficulty selector + OG image update
- **Difficulty system for private rooms**: host picks easy/medium/hard before creating
  - Easy (初級): TSL rank 1-400, no confusable/collocation, TOEIC 400-600
  - Medium (中級): TSL rank 1-800, all 5 question types, TOEIC 600-800
  - Hard (高級): full 5370 pool + all confusable/collocation, TOEIC 800+
  - Public matchmaking stays medium (no change)
  - Backend: `tslLoader.ts` adds `filterVocabByDifficulty()` + `DIFFICULTY_CONFIG`
  - Backend: `Matchmaker.ts` PrivateRoomState stores `difficulty` from host
  - Backend: `Room.ts` passes difficulty to `pickQuestions()`
  - Backend: `questions.ts` exports `Difficulty` type
  - Backend: `index.ts` validates difficulty in CREATE_PRIVATE handler
  - Backend: `LOBBY_UPDATE` broadcasts difficulty to all members
  - Frontend: `PlayWithFriendsSheet.tsx` — 3-button selector (green/amber/rose) with TOEIC score ranges
  - Frontend: `gameStore.ts` — `createPrivateRoom(difficulty)` param + `Difficulty` type export
  - Frontend: `LobbyState` interface now includes `difficulty?` field
  - i18n: `difficulty.title/easy/medium/hard/easyDesc/mediumDesc/hardDesc` (zh + en)
- **OG image replaced**: new yellow hand-drawn 多益派對 art with 4 characters
- **Read mobile changes**: tutorial sheet (5-step), BGM removed, Jump mode hidden, CTA shrunk

## 2026-05-06 (Mobile) — In-app tutorial
- New "**玩法教學**" entry on the home top-right (graduation-cap icon) next to the settings gear, plus a one-time auto-open for first-time visitors (`localStorage` flag `tp_tutorial_seen`)
- 5-step sheet (matches `PlayWithFriendsSheet` chrome — bottom sheet on mobile, centered card on desktop)
  1. Welcome / 4-player overview
  2. Lobby — pick character + ready
  3. Answering — A/B/C/D + timer urgency
  4. Combo + Skills row
  5. Result — crown / MVP / saved-words handoff
- "Screenshots" are real Tailwind/SVG mock-ups built with the same components / colours as the live UI, so they stay in sync without us shipping any PNGs (zero asset weight added)
- Step indicator dots, prev/next, skip-button (X) all i18n-keyed (`tutorial.*`, zh + en)

## 2026-05-06 (Mobile) — Remove BGM, shrink home CTA
- **Background music removed** — the looped Kenney jingles competed too noisily with the TTS in audio (listening) questions, making the listening prompts hard to hear. Pulled all of:
  - `frontend/public/audio/music/{lobby,game,result}.ogg` + README
  - `frontend/src/lib/music.ts`
  - `frontend/src/components/MusicSync.tsx` and its mount in `layout.tsx`
  - The "Music" toggle in `SettingsModal`
  - i18n keys `settings.music` / `settings.on` / `settings.off`
- The Web Audio SFX in `lib/sounds.ts` (correct / wrong / tick / combo / gameStart / gameEnd / skillReceived / rankUp) are left in place — those are short, don't overlap TTS, and add useful feedback.
- **Home CTA shrunk further**: `text-lg` + `tracking-[0.2em]` + `py-4` → `text-base` + `tracking-[0.15em]` + `py-3` so 「開戰！」 stays a single line and doesn't tower over the rest of the home column.

## 2026-05-06 (Mobile) — Background music
- Wired up looping BGM that auto-switches between **lobby / game / result** based on the game phase
  - `lib/music.ts`: small audio manager — single track at a time, ~600ms crossfade, fades to 0 on disable / tab hide
  - `components/MusicSync.tsx`: mounted once in root layout; subscribes to `phase` and unlocks autoplay on the first `pointerdown` / `keydown` (browsers block `<audio>.play()` until a user gesture)
  - SettingsModal: new "背景音樂" toggle (zh) / "Music" (en); preference persisted in localStorage (`tp_music_enabled`)
- **Tracks**: Kenney "Music Jingles" pack (CC0). Pulled from the GitHub mirror `Boyquotes/kenney-music-jingles-for-godot` since `kenney.nl` blocked direct curl from this sandbox.
  - `public/audio/music/lobby.ogg`  — Pizzicato (chamber-cute)
  - `public/audio/music/game.ogg`   — 8-bit NES (energetic)
  - `public/audio/music/result.ogg` — Steel (triumphant sting)
  - These are 3–5 second jingles looped — there's an audible seam. README in that folder explains how to swap in longer CC0 tracks later.

## 2026-05-06 (Mobile) — UX simplification round
- **Hide game-mode selector on home**: Jump mode is being deferred until I get back to it; with only Classic available, showing a single-option toggle was UI noise. The state still defaults to `'classic'` so `/game`'s Jump branch stays as inert dead code for when Jump comes back.
- **Shrink main CTA**: 「開戰！」 was rendering on two lines on narrow phones (`text-2xl` + `tracking-widest` was overflowing); dropped to `text-lg` with tighter tracking and slimmer padding (py-4).
- **Result page declutter**: removed the persistent "MY WORDS ({n})" button. The expandable per-match review block already covers post-game word recall; the full notebook still lives at /words from the home page.
- Cleaned up dead destructuring (`gameMode` / `setGameMode`) and unused `BookMarked` import.

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Hotfix: per-match word dedup
- Bug: with vocab + audio + fillblank each pulling questions independently from the same pool, the **same headword could appear twice in a single 10-question match** (once as vocab, once as audio). Players reported "單字好像都重複".
- Fix: `generateTSLQuestions` now passes a shared `excludeLower` set through each generator step; `pickWeighted` filters that set out of the pool before sampling. 200-game smoke test: 0 duplicates.
- Affected: `backend/src/data/tslLoader.ts`. No type-shape changes, no client changes needed.

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 4 (In-game Feedback Pt. 2)
Five more in-game UX wins:
- **Reverse overtake banner**: when another player passes you, a rose-coloured "X passed you!" banner with a ChevronDown icon now mirrors the existing green ascending banner. Light haptic buzz instead of a celebratory rank-up tone.
- **"Waiting for N more…" indicator**: backend now broadcasts ANSWER_PROGRESS after each answer. When you've locked in but the round hasn't resolved yet, a small pulsing dot + "Waiting for {n} more…" appears at the bottom.
- **Audio question telegraph**: the question card flashes a fuchsia ring on each new audio question so you don't miss "this one's a listening question" before the auto-play kicks in.
- **Self skill cast pose**: hitting a skill button briefly swaps your header avatar to the cheer1 sprite for 600ms (with a tilt-pop) so the caster gets visible feedback (until now only the receivers saw an effect).
- **Compact answer buttons during review**: AnswerButton drops to min-h-12 / smaller padding once an answer is revealed, leaving more room for the question card's definition reveal.

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 3 (In-game Feedback)
High-leverage in-game feedback / clarity work:
- **Review pause** lengthened from 4s → 5s when any human got it wrong (reading meaning + definition + example needs the extra second)
- **Timer urgency** beefed up: at ≤ 1s the pulse is bigger and faster (`timer-pulse-final`), and a red drop-shadow halo comes in at ≤ 3s and intensifies at ≤ 1s
- **Score breakdown** in the floating popup now also shows BASE / ⚡SPEED / 🔥COMBO chips so players learn why a fast/comboed answer scored more
- **Skill effect banner** (SHAKE / FOG / TIME CUT) gets a 2-second shrinking progress bar so the receiving player can see how long it'll last
- **Combo escalation**: at ≥ 5 the score row glows orange; at ≥ 7 a fullscreen "ON FIRE!" flash fires once on each new tier crossing
- **Review-phase ETA bar** at the bottom of /game shows when the next question is coming
- **Duplicate-character disambiguation**: the live ranking bar now puts a golden ring around the character icon for "you" so two players who picked the same character can still tell which one is them

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 2 (Polish + Char Picker Move)
- Icon consistency pass:
  - /game: 2 hand-rolled speaker SVGs → Volume2; question-type pills get Brain / Headphones / FileText; isFinal + final-round overlay get Flame; combo gets Flame above ×3; +N / WRONG feedback gets Check / X; SHAKE!/FOG!/TIME CUT! banner gets Waves / CloudFog / TimerOff
  - /result: review-toggle ▼/▲ → ChevronDown / ChevronUp
  - /words: filter pills get Layers / Star / AlertCircle / CheckCircle2 with count moved to a small tabular badge
  - Home: rules text replaced with Users / ListChecks / Clock chips; lobby empty slot's "?" → UserPlus icon; populated slot card padding tightened (px-2.5 py-2, 14×14 avatar)
  - RankingBar + RankingPanel: rank #1 shows filled Crown
  - SettingsModal: title / language / close get icons
  - AddWordModal: title / cancel / submit get icons
- **Character picker moved from home page → lobby.** Players can now change character during the wait, and other players see updates live.
  - New socket event: `CHANGE_CHAR { charIdx }`
  - `LOBBY_UPDATE` payload now includes `charIdx` per player; legacy fallback to slot index for older clients/servers
  - Home CTA simplified from "START AS {char}!" → "START!"
  - Player slots in the lobby render each player's chosen character (was previously hardcoded to slot index)
- Stale i18n cleanup: removed `home.rules`, `home.startAs`

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Sync Round
- Merged Desktop Rounds 1-4 (1156-word vocab + 1250 examples + better distractors)
- Adopted Desktop's `examples.json` as the single source of truth for example sentences; removed Mobile's hand-written `vocabExamples.ts` (50 entries, now superseded)
- Dropped vestigial `exampleZh` field everywhere — Desktop's DB is English-only; if Chinese examples come back later, add them as a separate field rather than reviving this one
- Plus this round's mobile-side work that pre-dated the merge:
  - Skills simplified to one-use-each per match (replaces 3-energy cost system)
  - All 34 emoji swapped to lucide-react icons (Settings / Dices / Crown / Zap / Flame / Volume2 / Star / RotateCw / BookMarked / Target / Users / Inbox / PartyPopper etc.)
  - Home redesign: private-room buttons collapsed into one "Play with friends" → bottom sheet; study row demoted to small icon row (BookMarked + Target with badge); mode buttons gained one-line descriptions ("快速 10 題" / "答錯出局"); Practice hidden + hint until ≥4 saved words
  - New `PlayWithFriendsSheet` component; `JoinRoomModal` deleted
  - PosBadge component for n./v./adj./adv. pills next to headwords
  - ExampleBlock highlights the headword in the example sentence
  - Server-side `sanitizePlayerName` filters control / zero-width / wide-space chars, slurs (EN+ZH leetspeak tolerant), and caps grapheme length

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 4: Supabase Persistence (Phase 2)
- **Database tables created**: players, matches, match_players, saved_words, leaderboard
- **Player accounts**: anonymous via device UUID (auto-created on first game)
- **Match history**: every game saved with all 4 players' scores
- **Leaderboard**: weekly + all-time, auto-updated after each game
- **Rank tiers**: auto-calculated (bronze→silver→gold→diamond based on XP)
- **Railway env vars**: SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_ANON_KEY + SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
- Backend: Room.ts saves async on GAME_END (non-blocking)
- Frontend: deviceId via crypto.randomUUID() sent with all match events
- E2E verified: Player created → Match saved → Leaderboard updated

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 3: Security Hardening
**Phase 1 pre-launch security — 4 fixes:**
1. **CORS locked down**: `origin: '*'` → whitelist (frontend domain + localhost + LAN IPs)
   - Custom domain support via `FRONTEND_URL` env var
2. **Rate limiting**: 
   - HTTP: 60 req/min via express-rate-limit
   - WebSocket: 50 events/10s per socket (custom tracker with auto-cleanup)
3. **Input validation**: all socket events validated
   - `answerIndex`: must be integer 0-3 (was unchecked)
   - `skillType`: must be shake/fog/timeCut (was unchecked)
   - `charIdx`: must be integer 0-3
   - `playerName`: max 16 chars + sanitized
   - `weakWords`: max 80 items, strings only
   - `code`: max 10 chars
   - Invalid input silently dropped (no crash)
4. **Sentry error tracking**: 
   - All socket handlers wrapped in try-catch → Sentry
   - `uncaughtException` + `unhandledRejection` caught
   - Socket error events logged
   - Set `SENTRY_DSN` env var to activate
- Global error handlers for uncaught exceptions
- Rate limit entries auto-cleaned every 30s

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 5: Cloud Sync + OG + Domain + Analytics
- **Cloud sync saved words**: auto push/pull to Supabase (no login needed)
  - App init: pull from cloud → merge localStorage
  - Game end / star / add / remove: push to cloud (async)
  - Frontend: lib/db.ts, @supabase/supabase-js
  - Railway env: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL + NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
- **OG image**: 多益派對 game art + OpenGraph + Twitter card meta

  - Real-time: players, matches, daily chart, leaderboard, tier distribution
  - Auto-refresh 60s, no server needed
- **Weak-word fix**: bias 70% → 30%, minimum 10 weak words to activate
  - Root cause: 3-5 wrong words → 70% of questions from same words → massive repetition

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 2
