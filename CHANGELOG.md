# Changelog

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Hotfix: per-match word dedup
- Bug: with vocab + audio + fillblank each pulling questions independently from the same pool, the **same headword could appear twice in a single 10-question match** (once as vocab, once as audio). Players reported "單字好像都重複".
- Fix: `generateTSLQuestions` now passes a shared `excludeLower` set through each generator step; `pickWeighted` filters that set out of the pool before sampling. 200-game smoke test: 0 duplicates.
- Affected: `backend/src/data/tslLoader.ts`. No type-shape changes, no client changes needed.

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 4 (In-game Feedback Pt. 2)
Five more in-game UX wins:
- **Reverse overtake banner**: when another player passes you, a rose-coloured "X passed you!" banner with a ChevronDown icon now mirrors the existing green ascending banner. Light haptic buzz instead of a celebratory rank-up tone.
- **"Waiting for N more…" indicator**: backend now broadcasts ANSWER_PROGRESS after each answer. When you've locked in but the round hasn't resolved yet, a small pulsing dot + "Waiting for {n} more…" appears at the bottom.
- **Audio question telegraph**: the question card flashes a fuchsia ring on each new audio question so you don't miss "this one's a listening question" before the auto-play kicks in.
- **Self skill cast pose**: hitting a skill button briefly swaps your header avatar to the cheer1 sprite for 600ms (with a tilt-pop) so the caster gets visible feedback (until now only the receivers saw an effect).
- **Compact answer buttons during review**: AnswerButton drops to min-h-12 / smaller padding once an answer is revealed, leaving more room for the question card's definition reveal.

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 3 (In-game Feedback)
High-leverage in-game feedback / clarity work:
- **Review pause** lengthened from 4s → 5s when any human got it wrong (reading meaning + definition + example needs the extra second)
- **Timer urgency** beefed up: at ≤ 1s the pulse is bigger and faster (`timer-pulse-final`), and a red drop-shadow halo comes in at ≤ 3s and intensifies at ≤ 1s
- **Score breakdown** in the floating popup now also shows BASE / ⚡SPEED / 🔥COMBO chips so players learn why a fast/comboed answer scored more
- **Skill effect banner** (SHAKE / FOG / TIME CUT) gets a 2-second shrinking progress bar so the receiving player can see how long it'll last
- **Combo escalation**: at ≥ 5 the score row glows orange; at ≥ 7 a fullscreen "ON FIRE!" flash fires once on each new tier crossing
- **Review-phase ETA bar** at the bottom of /game shows when the next question is coming
- **Duplicate-character disambiguation**: the live ranking bar now puts a golden ring around the character icon for "you" so two players who picked the same character can still tell which one is them

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Round 2 (Polish + Char Picker Move)
- Icon consistency pass:
  - /game: 2 hand-rolled speaker SVGs → Volume2; question-type pills get Brain / Headphones / FileText; isFinal + final-round overlay get Flame; combo gets Flame above ×3; +N / WRONG feedback gets Check / X; SHAKE!/FOG!/TIME CUT! banner gets Waves / CloudFog / TimerOff
  - /result: review-toggle ▼/▲ → ChevronDown / ChevronUp
  - /words: filter pills get Layers / Star / AlertCircle / CheckCircle2 with count moved to a small tabular badge
  - Home: rules text replaced with Users / ListChecks / Clock chips; lobby empty slot's "?" → UserPlus icon; populated slot card padding tightened (px-2.5 py-2, 14×14 avatar)
  - RankingBar + RankingPanel: rank #1 shows filled Crown
  - SettingsModal: title / language / close get icons
  - AddWordModal: title / cancel / submit get icons
- **Character picker moved from home page → lobby.** Players can now change character during the wait, and other players see updates live.
  - New socket event: `CHANGE_CHAR { charIdx }`
  - `LOBBY_UPDATE` payload now includes `charIdx` per player; legacy fallback to slot index for older clients/servers
  - Home CTA simplified from "START AS {char}!" → "START!"
  - Player slots in the lobby render each player's chosen character (was previously hardcoded to slot index)
- Stale i18n cleanup: removed `home.rules`, `home.startAs`

## 2026-05-05 (Mobile) — Sync Round
- Merged Desktop Rounds 1-4 (1156-word vocab + 1250 examples + better distractors)
- Adopted Desktop's `examples.json` as the single source of truth for example sentences; removed Mobile's hand-written `vocabExamples.ts` (50 entries, now superseded)
- Dropped vestigial `exampleZh` field everywhere — Desktop's DB is English-only; if Chinese examples come back later, add them as a separate field rather than reviving this one
- Plus this round's mobile-side work that pre-dated the merge:
  - Skills simplified to one-use-each per match (replaces 3-energy cost system)
  - All 34 emoji swapped to lucide-react icons (Settings / Dices / Crown / Zap / Flame / Volume2 / Star / RotateCw / BookMarked / Target / Users / Inbox / PartyPopper etc.)
  - Home redesign: private-room buttons collapsed into one "Play with friends" → bottom sheet; study row demoted to small icon row (BookMarked + Target with badge); mode buttons gained one-line descriptions ("快速 10 題" / "答錯出局"); Practice hidden + hint until ≥4 saved words
  - New `PlayWithFriendsSheet` component; `JoinRoomModal` deleted
  - PosBadge component for n./v./adj./adv. pills next to headwords
  - ExampleBlock highlights the headword in the example sentence
  - Server-side `sanitizePlayerName` filters control / zero-width / wide-space chars, slurs (EN+ZH leetspeak tolerant), and caps grapheme length

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 4: Supabase Persistence (Phase 2)
- **Database tables created**: players, matches, match_players, saved_words, leaderboard
- **Player accounts**: anonymous via device UUID (auto-created on first game)
- **Match history**: every game saved with all 4 players' scores
- **Leaderboard**: weekly + all-time, auto-updated after each game
- **Rank tiers**: auto-calculated (bronze→silver→gold→diamond based on XP)

## 2026-05-06 (Desktop) — Round 3: Security Hardening
**Phase 1 pre-launch security — 4 fixes:**
1. **CORS locked down**: `origin: '*'` → whitelist (frontend domain + localhost + LAN IPs)
   - Custom domain support via `FRONTEND_URL` env var
2. **Rate limiting**: 
   - HTTP: 60 req/min via express-rate-limit
   - WebSocket: 50 events/10s per socket (custom tracker with auto-cleanup)
3. **Input validation**: all socket events validated
   - `answerIndex`: must be integer 0-3 (was unchecked)
   - `skillType`: must be shake/fog/timeCut (was unchecked)
   - `charIdx`: must be integer 0-3
   - `playerName`: max 16 chars + sanitized
   - `weakWords`: max 80 items, strings only
   - `code`: max 10 chars
   - Invalid input silently dropped (no crash)
4. **Sentry error tracking**: 
   - All socket handlers wrapped in try-catch → Sentry
   - `uncaughtException` + `unhandledRejection` caught
   - Socket error events logged
   - Set `SENTRY_DSN` env var to activate
- Global error handlers for uncaught exceptions
- Rate limit entries auto-cleaned every 30s
